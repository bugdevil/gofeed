Gofeed was inspired by feed43.com.

**NOT FINISHED YET**

gofeed parses some web pages into full-text feed. This simple program is written when I start to learn golang. So it may be buggy and not ready to use currently.

## TODO

1. Better readme file
2. Cache old requests: use sqlite to cache downloaded web pages and save their lastmod time.
3. Add alternative methods to extract feed title, link and content from html
    1. xpath
